**tox-gh-actions** is a tox plugin which helps running tox on GitHub Actions
with multiple different Python versions on multiple workers in parallel.
This project is inspired by [tox-travis](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-travis).

*If you want to use this plugin with tox v4,
please check [the tox4 branch](https://github.com/ymyzk/tox-gh-actions/tree/tox4).*

## Features
When running tox on GitHub Actions, tox-gh-actions
* detects which environment to run based on configurations and
* provides utilities such as [grouping log lines](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/commands.md#group-and-ungroup-log-lines)
  and [annotating error messages](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/problem-matchers.md).

## Usage
1. Add configurations under `[gh-actions]` section along with tox's configuration.
   - It will be `pyproject.toml`, `tox.ini`, or `setup.cfg`. See [tox's documentation](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) for more details.

2. Install `tox-gh-actions` package in the GitHub Actions workflow before running `tox` command.

## Examples
### Basic Example
The following configuration will create 4 jobs when running the workflow on GitHub Actions.
- On Python 3.7 job, tox runs `py37` environment
- On Python 3.8 job, tox runs `py38` environment
- On Python 3.9 job, tox runs `py39` environment
- On Python 3.10 job, tox runs `py310` and `mypy` environments

#### tox-gh-actions Configuration
Add `[gh-actions]` section to the same file as tox's configuration.

If you're using `tox.ini`:
```ini
[tox]
envlist = py37, py38, py39, py310, mypy

[gh-actions]
python =
    3.7: py37
    3.8: py38
    3.9: py39
    3.10: py310, mypy

[testenv]
...
```

If you're using `setup.cfg`:
```ini
[tox:tox]
envlist = py37, py38, py39, py310, mypy

[gh-actions]
python =
    3.7: py37
    3.8: py38
    3.9: py39
    3.10: py310, mypy

[testenv]
...
```

If you're using `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.tox]
legacy_tox_ini = """
[tox]
envlist = py37, py38, py39, py310, mypy

[gh-actions]
python =
    3.7: py37
    3.8: py38
    3.9: py39
    3.10: py310, mypy

[testenv]
"""
```

#### Workflow Configuration
`.github/workflows/<workflow>.yml`:
```yaml
name: Python package

on:
  - push
  - pull_request

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.7', '3.8', '3.9', '3.10']

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install tox tox-gh-actions
    - name: Test with tox
      run: tox
```

### Advanced Examples
#### Factor-Conditional Settings: Python Version
The following configuration will create 2 jobs when running the workflow on GitHub Actions.
- On Python 2.7 job, tox runs `py27-django111` environment
- On Python 3.7 job, tox runs `py37-django111` and `py37-django20` environments

`tox.ini`:
```ini
[tox]
envlist = py27-django{111}, py37-django{111,20}

[gh-actions]
python =
    2.7: py27
    3.7: py37

[testenv]
...
```

When using pre-release versions of Python, please do not specify `-beta` or `-dev` in `tox.ini`.

`.github/workflows/<workflow>.yml`:
```yaml
...
jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.10', 3.11.0-beta.3]
...
```

`tox.ini`:
```ini
[tox]
envlist = py310, py311

[gh-actions]
python =
    3.10: py310
    3.11: py311
    # The following won't work
    # 3.11-beta.3: py311
    # 3.11-dev: py311

[testenv]
...
```

PyPy is also supported in the `python` configuration key.
Support of Pyston is experimental and not tested by our CI.

 `tox.ini`:
```ini
[tox]
envlist = py27, py310, pypy2, pypy3, pyston38

[gh-actions]
python =
    2.7: py27
    3.10: py310, mypy
    pypy-2.7: pypy2
    pypy-3.7: pypy3
    pyston-3.8: pyston38

[testenv]
...

[testenv:pyston38]
basepython = pyston38
```

You can also specify without minor versions in the `python` configuration key.

`tox.ini`:
```ini
[tox]
envlist = py2, py3, pypy2, pypy3

[gh-actions]
python =
    2: py2
    3: py3, mypy
    pypy-2: pypy2
    pypy-3: pypy3

    # Using pypy2 and pypy3 as a key in still supported for backward compatibility
    # but the support will be removed in tox-gh-actions v3.
    # pypy2: pypy2
    # pypy3: pypy3

[testenv]
...
```

If there are multiple matching Python versions in the configuration, only the most precise one is used.
For example, if you are running CPython 3.10 and `gh-actions.python` has both `3` and `3.10`,
tox-gh-actions gets factors only from the key `3.10`.

#### Factor-Conditional Settings: Environment Variable
You can also use environment variable to decide which environment to run.
The following is an example to install different dependency based on platform.
It will create 12 jobs when running the workflow on GitHub Actions.
- On Python 2.7/ubuntu-latest job, tox runs `py27-linux` environment
- On Python 3.10/ubuntu-latest job, tox runs `py310-linux` environment
- and so on.

`.github/workflows/<workflow>.yml`:
```yaml
name: Python package

on:
  - push
  - pull_request

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.platform }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        platform: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        python-version: [2.7, 3.8, 3.9, '3.10']

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install tox tox-gh-actions
    - name: Test with tox
      run: tox
      env:
        PLATFORM: ${{ matrix.platform }}
```

`tox.ini`:
```ini
[tox]
envlist = py{27,38,39,310}-{linux,macos,windows}

[gh-actions]
python =
    2.7: py27
    3.8: py38
    3.9: py39
    3.10: py310

[gh-actions:env]
PLATFORM =
    ubuntu-latest: linux
    macos-latest: macos
    windows-latest: windows

[testenv]
deps =
  <common dependency>
  linux: <Linux specific deps>
  macos: <macOS specific deps>
  windows: <Windows specific deps>
...
```

See [tox's documentation about factor-conditional settings](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#factors-and-factor-conditional-settings) as well.

### Overriding Environments to Run
_Changed in 2.0_: When a list of environments to run is specified explicitly via `-e` option or `TOXENV` environment variable ([tox's help](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example/general.html#selecting-one-or-more-environments-to-run-tests-against)),
tox-gh-actions respects the given environments and simply runs the given environments without enforcing its configuration.

Before 2.0, tox-gh-actions was always enforcing its configuration even when a list of environments is given explicitly.

## Versioning
This project follows [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) and uses a format of major.minor.patch (X.Y.Z).
The major version (X) will be incremented when we make backward incompatible changes to a public API.
The public API of this project is the configuration of tox-gh-actions.
The major version can be also incremented when we require a new version of tox.

This project tries not to introduce backward incompatibles changes as much as possible so that users don't need to
update their project's configuration too frequently.

## Understanding Behavior of tox-gh-actions
### How tox-gh-actions Works
See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for more details.

### Logging
tox-gh-actions writes log messages using `tox.reporter`.
This is handy for understanding behavior of tox-gh-actions and for debugging tox-gh-actions.
To see the log messages, please run `tox -vv`.
